For creating a new project, you must:

1. Create a repository
2. Clone the repository to your machine	
	- Copy clone link
	- Create a general directory for the project (i.e. "C:\Documents\Python")
	- "git clone [link here]"
	- Now a project folder exists in current directory (i.e. "...\Python\Project")
3. Add files to repository
	- Drag files into project directory
	- "git add -A" ("-A" is for all files, you can do individual files)
4. Commit files
	- "git commit" or "git commit -m 'your message' "
5. Push files
	- "git push"


NOTE: You can check on the status of files using the command "git status"
